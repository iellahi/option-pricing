# Option Pricing with Monte Carlo

I developed Python scripts to compute option prices using the Black-Scholes Model and Monte Carlo methods as part of my work for the Directed Reading Program in Mathematics at Florida State University. I computed exact and derived option prices and implemented stochastic simulations to assess price convergence. I optimized Monte Carlo simulations by refining random sampling techniques to improve accuracy, and visualized pricing distributions and sensitivity analyses using Matplotlib (data visualization tool). You can see the graphs in the poster below.
